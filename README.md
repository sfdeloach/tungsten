*GOAL*-- Create a spreadsheet-like post form that allows the user to insert new rows as needed. There should be a drop down box in the first column of each row that provides a fixed list of names. Once a name from the list is selected, several additional columns such as DOB, age, and sex should auto-populate. Experiment with the [Foundation front-end framework](http://foundation.zurb.com).
